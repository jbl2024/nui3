//! Interactive portable console
/*!
The console represents a simple terminal connnected to the current application,
allowing text ouput and user input. An application can have only one console
at once, or no console at all. To ensure there is only one instance at once,
the reference to the console object is held in the application instance. It means
that instantiating a new console object will automatically a) delete any
previous instance and b) attach the new console to the application. Exemple :

\code
new nglConsole();
nglConsole& con = App->GetConsole();
con.UseHistory();
con.UseCompletion();
con.Show();
\endcode

You can fetch the reference to the current console object with \a App->GetConsole().
NGL does not automatically instantiate a console object at application startup.
However, if the user did not provided a console and \a App->GetConsole() is called,
the default console (of type \e nglConsole) is immediatly built and used. It means
that the example above still works the same if the first line is removed.

The default console is implemented in different ways, depending on the platform :

- Windows user have a new option in each NGL window system menu (the icon on
the top left corner) to display the console. You can programmatically force
the display of the console (or hide it) with the Show() method.
The Window console is a 'handcrafted' facility.

- Unix-like terminal emulators (xterm, getty and co.) are automatically used as
the NGL console when launched through them. Applications not attached to a tty
(such as those run with the ending '&' shell directive, or by third party launchers
such as you favorite desktop browser) cannot have a 'true' console support. The
output will still be written to stdout, but no interactive input is possible
(even with pipes). From the programmer's point of view, everything works the same
but the input and completion callbacks will never be called.
The Show() method only controls the apparition of the prompt.


\par Using input

If you want to receive and interpret console input, you must create
your own console class from nglConsole and overload the OnInput() method. Example :

\code
class MyConsole : public nglConsole
{
public:
  MyConsole() : nglConsole (true) // Show on creation
  {
    UseHistory();
    UseCompletion();
  }

  virtual void OnInput (const nglString& rLine)
  {
    if (!rLine.Compare("exit")) Quit (0); else
      NGL_OUT ("sorry, unknown command\n");
  }
};

MyApplication::OnInit()
{
  new MyConsole(); // And voila !
}
\endcode

This code does the same job as the first example : it creates a console,
activates history and completion and shows it at startup. But here you can
overload the OnInput() and OnCompletion() callbacks and program an interactive
console. Since the application console is used as default output for the log
facility (see nglLog), it is a good idea to instantiate your console as soon as
possible (there is no sooner than the first line of application's \a OnInit() !).


\par Using Output

You might want to intercept the default console output, to display it in a
nglWindow with the help of nuiFont for instance. All you have to do is to
overload the OnOutput() callback and code a drawing routine.
Here is a little example showing how to code a GL console based on this principle :

\code
class GLConsole : public nglConsole
{
  nglString mBacklog;

public:
  GLConsole() : nglConsole (false) {} // Hide default console

  virtual void OnOutput (const nglString& rLine)
  {
    mBacklog += rLine;
    Draw();
  }

  void Draw()
  {
    // Here some GL code to display mBacklog content
  }
};
\endcode


\par History and completion

The NGL console can manage two major services for you : \e history and \e completion.

History is not automatically available, you must call UseHistory() first.
When enabled, a call to AddToHistory() will insert a new entry into history,
and the user will be able navigate through the last entries with the \e up and
\e down cursor keys. Usually AddToHistory() is called from the OnInput()
callback. The history buffer can be limited by line count and/or
total chars count, or not limited at all, see SetHistory().

You can also enable \e history \e expansion, which is a facility inspired from
GNU readline. The user can begin a line with the '!' (exclamation) character,
and type the first few letters of a recent command. If expansion is enabled,
the console will automatically search (from more recent to older entries) an
entry in history matching these first letters when the user strikes 'enter'.
Matching case sensitiveness is controled via SetHistoryCase().
The '!!' expression is interpreted as 'repeat last command'.
If completion is enabled, it is also possible to complete against history
(see \e completion below).

Completion is not automatically available, you must call UseCompletion() first.
When enabled, the user can trigger a completion request by hitting the \e Tab
key. The OnCompletion() callback is triggered, and you are required to give
a list of matching items from a context (current line and word to complete).
If only one item (one match) is returned, the current word is immediatly
replaced with this item. If several matches are returned, the current word is
replaced with the least common denominator of all matches : these are the first
similar characters of all matches, 'similarity' case sensitiveness being
controlled by SetCompletionCase(). When no further completion is possible,
hitting \e Tab twice display all possible matches.
See OnCompletion() documentation for more informations.

If both \e history \e expansion and \e completion are enabled, a completion
request on the first word (beginning of the line) \e and with a heading '!'
is automatically completed against history. The OnCompletion() callback
is not triggered in this case, since it is internally handled by NGL.

    \param Start start of current word (char index in rLine)
    \param End position of cursor (char index in rLine)
    \param rAppendTo list to complete with possible matches (initially empty)

    When the user requests completion (by hitting the \a Tab key), this method is called
    with the current context. You should provide a list of matches based on the substring
    delimited by the \a Start position (first letter of the word to complete) and one
    step before the \a End position (cursor pos). Example :

\code
std::list<nglString>& MyConsole::OnCompletion (nglString& rLine,
                                               uint Start,
                                               uint End,
                                               std::list<nglString>& rAppendTo)
{
  char* commands[] = {"cd", "ls", "echo", "exit", NULL};
  char* args[] = {"toto.jpg", "README", "test.xml", NULL};
  int i;

  if (Start == 0) // first word, this is a command
  {
    // End == 0 : no text entered, propose all commands
    for (i = 0; commands[i]; i++)
      if ((End == 0) || (!rLine.Compare (commands[i], Start, End-Start)))
        rAppendTo.push_front (nglString (commands[i]));
  }
  else // this is a command argument
  {
    // Start == End : no text entered, propose all args
    for (i = 0; args[i]; i++)
      if ((Start == End) || (!rLine.Compare (args[i], Start, End-Start)))
        rAppendTo.push_front (nglString (args[i]));
  }
  return rAppendTo;
}
\endcode

    The current word is completed with the least common denominator of the returned
    list, if non void. The identification of the first common letters of the matches
    is controlled by the SetCompletionCase() method.
    The list is also sorted and displayed when the user hits the \e Tab key twice.

    When the line is empty, expect both \a Start and \a End to be zero. In any case,
    check the case where the word to complete is empty (End == Start) is properly
    handled.

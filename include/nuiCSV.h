  By default, the comments are disabled in the nuiCSV object. The CSV syntaxe doesn't define anything about comments.
  We choosed to add this option in case you need it inside your own application. Most of the csv importers (Excel...) allows to manually skip the first line(s) if thoses ones
  don't provide any csv data. But remember there is no official rule about comments.
  Once the comments are enabled : 
  - you can use the InsertComment() method to add some comments in your csv output
  - the Load() method is able to parse the comments correctly when reading the input stream
